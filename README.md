This package provides a robust solution for face detection using a shape predictor and OpenCV. It utilizes pre-trained shape predictor models to accurately detect facial landmarks, such as eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline, enabling precise face detection and alignment. The package leverages OpenCV for image processing and real-time face tracking, making it suitable for applications like facial recognition, emotion detection, and augmented reality. With support for both image and video inputs, the package is easy to integrate into existing Python projects for a wide range of face detection tasks.

Note: Make sure both OpenCV and the shape predictor are properly installed before using the package. You can install OpenCV via pip install opencv-python and ensure the shape predictor model file (e.g., shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) is correctly placed in your working directory.
This code will work on raspberry pi 4 and 5 .
Remember to change the path inside the script to the actual path of shape predictor in your pi.
